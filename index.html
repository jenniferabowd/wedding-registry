              We already have many of the things you would consider ‘traditional’ wedding registry gifts. The other things we would consider nonessential - we do not want a million towels or a really nice silverware set that you will use once. However, there a few things you can help with that will greatly increase our quality of life.

              We already have many of the things you would consider ‘traditional’ wedding registry gifts. When we first moved in together, we had 15 towels, 14 pillows, and 12 place settings of plates, bowls and silverware. We are still working on giving some of this stuff away to friends. We also do not have the space (350 square feet) for non-essential items, such as a bread maker or fine China. However, there are a few things you can help with that will greatly increase our quality of life.

              If you have talked to John recently you probably know that he bought a small, old, studio apartment. He had hope of someday renovating it using his architectural skills and knowledge. Now that two people and a really nice old cat live in the small studio, it is time to make that dream a reality. Jen loves to bake and John loves to cook. As you can see from the pictures, this can be a challenge.

              We would rather improve our current living situation than move, due to financial constraints. Help us stay here as long as possible - your gift towards our studio renovation, or honeymoon that we plan to take during demolition, will go much further than traditional registry goods. Your gifts will add value to our everyday lives and property - it will be the gift that keeps on giving.
