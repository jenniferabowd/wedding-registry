          <h1>Jen Kaplan and John Abowd's Wedding Registry</h1>
          <p>
            We have decided not to do a traditional wedding registry. When we first moved in together, we had 15 towels, 2 queen sized pillows, 3 sets of plates and bowls, and 3 sets of silverware. We are still working on giving this stuff away to friends who will use it. This does not even include the furniture we had to give away. We feel it would be wasteful to ask for anything of that nature because we already have all the household items we need.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead, we really could use a new kitchen. Our kitchen didn’t work for John even when he lived alone. Now that Jen lives here too in this small studio it is a big reason why we would be more comfortable in a larger apartment. However, with the current kitchen, John would lose money on the sale if you add up the sales fees. Our smartest financial move is to focus on making this apartment work for as long as possible by saving to renovate the kitchen. Renovating the kitchen will greatly increase the value of John’s apartment and allow us to live here a while longer.  
            <br>
            <br>
            In more candid terms, after speaking to a real estate agent and financial planner, if we put in $10,000 into the kitchen (not asking for that amount of money, we are also saving up on our own), we would increase the value of our apartment by at least $20,000. Unrenovated studios are worth between $145,000-$155,000 in this building, while renovated studios are worth around $180,000. That would put us in a great financial place to buy a bigger apartment in a few years when the timing is right and still have good savings for emergencies. This would greatly help us set up our life together in our ideal home.
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason why we will still want to sell in a few years is this is a 400 square foot studio apartment. There isn’t a wall for privacy except in the bathroom. While a new kitchen would make things easier, having such a small apartment without a private bedroom can only be livable as a couple for so long. This apartment also makes calling people tricky since the other person can hear the entire phone call.
            <br>
            <br>
            To help people understand our plan, right now there is a closet in a horrible location. We want to move the closet to the hallway. Then we want to expand the kitchen to include the space where the closet was.
            <br>
            <br>
            We also plan on taking our honeymoon during the worst parts of the renovations. If people would rather contribute to the honeymoon, that would be amazing too. We are hoping that our honeymoon is at least 10 days, but 14 days would be amazing.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you would like to contribute, you can mail us a check, send John a Paypal via his Gmail (if you need that, please reach out to one of us), or Venmo either of us. We could also use airline miles for the honeymoon.
